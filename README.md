Training a CNN to classify images into different categories using a dataset CIFAR-10.
Steps:
1. Obtain the CIFAR-10 dataset of labeled images.
2. Preprocess the data (e.g., normalization).
3. Design and implement a CNN architecture with convolutional and pooling layers.
4. Training the CNN on the dataset and evaluate its performance on the testset using accuracy and other relevant metrics.
